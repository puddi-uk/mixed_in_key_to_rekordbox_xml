# Update Rekordbox keys/tonalities from Mixed In Key comments.

Assumes that if Mixed in Key has been used the Comments will start with the key/tonality it identified, e.g. "1A - Energy 6".

For all tracks in the rekordbox.xml the Rekordbox tonality is compared with the tonality in the Comments and if it differs then the one from the Comments is used instead.

## Instructions

1. In Main.java:
    1. Update the location of your recordbox.xml
    1. Update the scale format to be output (Camelot or Classical).
1. Launch Main.java
1. If tonalities have been updated then a new version of rekordbox.xml named "puddi_uk_updated_rekordbox.xml" will be written beside your existing one.

_Note: You can force the updated file to be written by changing the value of FORCE_UPDATE in TonalityUpdater.java. This allows conversion of scale formats even if the Rekordbox and Mixed in Key tonalities are the same._
